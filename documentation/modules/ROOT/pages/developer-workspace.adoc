= Get your Developer Sandbox and Workspace
:navtitle: Get your Developer Sandbox and Workspace

_20 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn about getting your Red hat Developer Sandbox with a Kubernetes-native development platform 
and getting familiar with the OpenShift CLI, OpenShift Web Console and CodeReady Workspaces.


[#get_your_developer_sandbox]
== Getting your Developer Sandbox for OpenShift

The Red Hat Developer Sandbox is a great way to 
access Red Hat’s products and technologies without setup or configuration, and start developing quicker than ever 
before with our new sandbox environments for Red Hat OpenShift and CodeReady Workspaces Try your hand at the technologies 
with our library of activities as well.

The https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox for OpenShift^] is a Kubernetes-native environment for developing 
software for OpenShift. You need to follow the *Get Started* process on this web site first, before attempting any of the workshop steps below.

After verifying your email or mobile number you should you get access to your sandbox and be given a link to a login page to access the OpenShift Web Console, which looks like this:-

[#login_to_openshift]
== Log in to the OpenShift Developer Console

OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to
perform various tasks via a browser.

Please login using the credentials provided when requesting the Developer Sandbox.

After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a
list of projects that your user has permission to work with. 

`*Select the 'Developer View' then your "-stage" project*` to be taken to the project overview page
which will list all of the routes, services, deployments, and pods that you have
running as part of your project. There's maybe nothing much there now, but that's about to
change.

image::codereadyworkspaces-logo.png[CodeReady Workspaces, 400]

https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^] is a Kubernetes-native IDE and developer collaboration platform.

As an open-source project, the core goals of https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^]  are to:

* **Accelerate project and developer onboarding:** As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^]  makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project.
* **Remove inconsistency between developer environments:** No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment.
* **Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness:** As https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^]  becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines.

To achieve those core goals, https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^]  provides:

* **Workspaces:** Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications.
* **Browser-based IDEs:** Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tooling, debuggers, terminal, VCS integration, and much more.
* **Extensible platform:** Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using plug-ins, which are compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions.
* **Enterprise Integration:** Multi-user capabilities, including Keycloak for authentication and integration with LDAP or AD.

[#get_your_developer_workspace]
== Getting your CodeReady Workspace

https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^]  will provide you an out-of-box 
*Developer Workspace* with all the tools and the dependencies we need to do the job. **And with only one single click!**

[NOTE]
.Devfile
====
https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^] uses https://devfile.io/docs/devfile/2.1.0/user-guide/index.html[Devfiles^] to automate the provisioning of a specific workspace by defining:

* projects to clone
* browser IDE to use
* preconfigured commands
* tools that you need
* application runtime definition

Providing a https://github.com/florianmoss/cloud-native-workshop/blob/5.1/devfile.yaml[devfile.yaml^] file inside a Git source repository signals to https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^] to configure the project and runtime according 
to this file.
====

CodeReady Workspaces is integrated into the Developer Sandox and is available from the OpenShift Web Console usng the *apps* button in the header bar.

[window=_blank, align="center"]
[role='params-link']
image::launch-crw.png[Launch CodeReady Workspaces, 300]

Then `*login*` and let the magic happens...

When CodeReady Workspaces starts, enter the following URL into the *Git Repo URL* field to load the devfile and click `*Create & Open*`

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]

[window=_blank, align="center"]
image::enter-devfile.png[Launching the workspace , 500]

Once completed, you will have a fully functional Browser-based IDE within the source code already imported and 
the IDE configured for our workshop tasks. Deploying this workspace can take 2-3 minutes due to the resource constraints on the sandbox.

[#connect_your_workspace]
== Connect Your Workspace to Your OpenShift Project

Now you need to connect your CodeReady Workspace environment to your OpenShift development area i.e your project or namespace.

First, in the OpenShift Developer console you need to `*Copy Your Login command*` which includes your authentication token for OpenShift access.
The *Copy login command* can be found in the top right header bar of the web page under your login name:

[window=_blank, align="center"]
image::copy-login-command.png[Copy Login command , 300]

Then you can follow the link to *Display the Token*:

[window=_blank, align="center"]
image::display-token.png[Copy Login command , 300]

[window=_blank, align="center"]
image::login-token.png[Login Token, 700]

Now `*copy*` the whole *oc login* command, token and server address:

Switching back to your CodeReady workspace.

image::che-open-terminal.png[Che - RunTask, 500]

Open a '>_ workshop_tools' terminal window, `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Open Terminal in specific container' ->  'workshop-tools'*`

Now `*paste*` the *oc login* command into the terminal window created at the bottom of the browser page and *execute*.


[tabs, subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====


--
====

The output should be as follows:

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----

$ oc login --token=sha256~yv5Y1pcRsrxxxxxxxxxx --server=https://api.sandbox-m2.ll9k.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443
Logged into "https://api.sandbox-m2.ll9k.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443" as "user" using the token provided.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * florianmoss-dev
    florianmoss-stage

Using project "florianmoss-dev".
Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
----

To make sure the CodeReady development environment is setup for the development tools you will use you need one more 
terminal command to complete this:-

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
odo project set ${CHE_WORKSPACE_NAMESPACE}-stage
----

And this should confirm the action with a response like this:

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
Switched to project : florianmoss-stage
----


Make sure to accept the prompt in the bottom right corner of your screen, as seen below:

[#what_is_odo]
== What is OpenShift Do (odo)?

[sidebar]
.OpenShift Do (odo)
--

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/cli_reference/developer_cli_odo/understanding-odo.html[OpenShift Do (odo)^] is a CLI tool for creating applications on OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes. 
With https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/cli_reference/developer_cli_odo/understanding-odo.html[odo^], you can write, build, and debug applications on a cluster without the need to administer the cluster itself. 
Creating deployment configurations, build configurations, service routes and other OpenShift Container Platform or Kubernetes elements are all automated by https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/cli_reference/developer_cli_odo/understanding-odo.html[odo^].

Existing tools such as https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[OpenShift CLI (oc)^] are operations-focused and require a deep understanding of Kubernetes and OpenShift Container Platform concepts. 
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/cli_reference/developer_cli_odo/understanding-odo.html[odo^] abstracts away complex Kubernetes and OpenShift Container Platform concepts allowing developers to focus on what is most important to them: **code**.

*Now you are ready to get started with the labs!*



[#trouble_shooting_tips]
== Workshop Trouble Shooting Tips

We hope you have a good workshop, but here are a few tips and tricks that may make it run better.

=== What browser should I be using for this workshop?

The whole workshop runs in your browser environment which allows us to support a variety of developer platforms from Windows, Mac and Linux.
We find the best browser for this workshop is *Firefox* or *Chrome* browser.

=== Workshop stops or freezes ===

Everything here is browser based so might have the odd glitch. The easiets resoltuion to a number of problems is just to refresh the browser, 
or worse case restart the browser. All you work is stored centrally on our services so you should juts be able to re-attach 
to your workspace and OpenShift project and continue. If refreshing the browser doesn't seem to work then try closing the CodeReady browser tab 
and re-launch it from the OpenShift Web Console usng the *apps* button in the header bar.

[window=_blank, align="center"]
[role='params-link']
image::launch-crw.png[Launch CodeReady Workspaces, 300]

=== Having problems seeing CodeReady Workspace? ===

CodeReady Workspaces use secure web sockets for its UI. If you are having problems try this test web site https://websocketstest.com. 
All results should be green to proceed. If this test fails please check that you a direct access to the internet, i.e disable any VPNs
web proxies etc. If you are using a corporate device you may need to switch to a personal computer.

=== I've been logged out or need to restart the workspace ===

The workshop will take a few hours to complete all the way through, if you use the system continuosly throughout 
that period you will not see this issue.

*Re-login to the Red Hat* Your authentication token will need to refresh for security so expect to have login again. 
You will need you Sandbox credentials daily but they should be cached.

*Re-login from CodeReady* CodeReady can perform local tasks like builds, but usually needs to connect to your openShift project
to deploy. If your CodeReady deployment tasks fail chance are you need to re-login to OpenShift from CodeReady. Use the instruction
on this page *Connect Your Workspace to Your OpenShift project*. Also make sure you check that your `*-stage*` project is selected.

*Restart CodeReady Workspaces* To save resources CodeReady will idle down. You may need to open or start your workspace again. After doing this, 
please check that you repeat the *Connect Your Workspace to Your OpenShift project* step.

=== My OpenShift pods have all gone to idle ===

If left for a long period (like overnight) your OpenShift project will idle down all its running pods. On the 
Topology display they will show up with white rings. Normally these rings would be dark blue if the pod is active. You need to select each 
*Deployment* or *DeploymentConfig* that you have created in turn by clicking on the circle, then on the pop-out select the blue (D) or (DC) text. 
Then using the circle marked as *Scaled to 0* increase the Pod count up to 1. The ring should turn blue aftre about 30 seconds.

=== How do I cleanup after running this workshop? ===

There is a terminal task included in the workshop to delete all the elements of the Inner Loop workshop.

*Click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'OpenShift - Cleanup'*
